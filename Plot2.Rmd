Exploratory Data analysis Project 2
========================================================

The R script for Plot 2 of the 1st Exploratory Data analysis project.

The script works on the assumption that the data file is downloaded seperately and is stored in a folder along with another folder which contains the Github Repository. This prevents the the dataset file from being pushed to Github


The script also assumes the user has set thier working directory to the folder containing the dataset and the repo.



```{r}
EPC <- read.table("household_power_consumption.txt", sep = ";",na.strings = "NA", header = TRUE)
setwd("./ExData_Plotting")
EPC[,1] <-as.character(EPC[,1])
EPC[,1] <- as.Date(as.character(EPC[,1]), "%d/%m/%Y")
EPC <- EPC[EPC$Date >= as.Date(" 2007-02-01") & EPC$Date <= as.Date(" 2007-02-02"), ]

for (i in 3:8) {
  EPC[,i] <-as.numeric(as.character(EPC[,i]))
  
}
EPC$DateTime <- as.POSIXct(paste(EPC$Date, EPC$Time), format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

par(mfrow = (c(1,1)))


with(EPC, plot(DateTime,Global_active_power, type = "l",  ylab = "Global Active Power (Kilowatts)") )
```
